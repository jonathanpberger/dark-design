# TDD for Design Scratchpad

# ******************* Shower Notes

Where does TDD fit into Think -> Make -> Check

---

- "I code and design" => describe TDD workflow in dev, set up "I want this for design. What might that look like?"

- subj/obj => design pyramid

- ghost story benefit: declaritive testing benefit: ontological design story is told in code. This is probably the top of the pyramid

- think about how dev test Pyramid involves rendered results vs declarative statements. how much is a priori? in dev, unit tests are declarative, closest to math, closest to a priori. In Design, it may be inverted.

- use a geo font w/ lots of triangles

# Software development had problems

- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

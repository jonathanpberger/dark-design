# The Lighter Side of Dark Design

## Using Dark Design patterns (for good!) in Agile UX practice.

# What is "Dark Design"?

---

# Dark != Evil

![Evil By Design](images/evil_by_design.png)

???

- Chris Nodder wrote this nice book
- outlines lots of evil patterns

---

# Dark Design is a *technique*, not a value claim

---

class: greenbg

### Case study:

# cops & witness identification

---

# the client


- philanthropic foundation
- focused on social justice
- "how can we do the most good?"

---

# What's the most bad?


--



class: warning



.f1[death-row inmates subsequently exonerated by DNA evidence]


---

# Leading cause?


--


- Jailhouse snitching


--


- Faulty witness ID

???

- lots of social science wrt bias, lineups
- easy to study? who cares!
- spare innocent people from death row!

---

# the app


--


- Cops create a lineup


--


- Witnesses pick the suspect out of the lineup


--


- Court sees witness ID firsthand


???

- remember that movie "The Usual Suspects?"

## What do you think of when you hear "lineup"?


--


class: center


![The Usual Suspects](images/usual_suspects.jpg)

???

- This is many ppl think of when we hear "lineup"
- "Simultanous array"


---

class: warning

### e.g.,

# Let's say You're a witness to a crime: a man snatches a bag and runs off.

???
- cop interviews witnesses
- they want to ID the suspect
- one suspect photo, the rest are "filler"

---

## Simultaneous Array vs. Sequential Array

- In simultaneous lineups, witnesses must use "relative judgment" to compare lineup photographs to **each other**.

- For sequential lineups, witnesses must exercise "absolute judgment," comparing each photograph to their **memory of the offender**.

> Investigated the effectiveness of sequential lineup presentation as a means of reducing false identifications with little or no loss in accurate identifications.

> A crime was staged for 240 unsuspecting eyewitnesses (undergraduates) either individually or in pairs. One-fourth of the Ss attempted identifications in each of 4 lineup conditions: 6 pictures were presented either simultaneously, as used in traditional procedures, or sequentially, in which yes/no judgments were made for each picture; each procedure either contained the photograph of the criminalâ€“confederate or a picture of a similar looking replacement.

> Results indicate that sequential lineup presentation significantly reduced false identifications but did not significantly influence correct identifications when compared with a simultaneous procedure. **It is concluded that sequential presentation of lineups can reduce false identifications of innocent suspects by reducing eyewitnesses' reliance on relative-judgment processes.**

???

- here is a fancy citation
- it says sequential lineups are better

# Witness description

> White male, middle aged, dark hair. Medium height, medium build.

## Simultaneous Array


--



![Simultaneous Lineup](images/simultaneous-lineup.jpg)

---

## Simultaneous Array

- Each face is compared to each other
- **Closest to witness memory** is selected

---

## Sequential array

- Each face is compared against witness memory
- Fewer false identifications

### Dark Design Pattern #1:

#introduce an app to make the preferred behavior the default behavior

???

- Encourage police to use sequential arrays.
- even though people may be averse to change
- build the app; make it easier to do the right thing than wrong

---

class: warning

# We've got a lead!

--


- There've been a rash of similar crimes in the area


--


- Police have a suspect

# Suspect Selection

![Suspect selection](images/suspect-mugshot-selection-flow.png)

---

class: small-image


![Suspect selection](images/suspect_mugshot_selection_2-suspect-detail.png)

???

- this guy has a record
- most recent photo has goatee
- we want to match the witness description

---

class: small-image


![Suspect selection](images/suspect_mugshot_selection_3-suspect-photo-detail.png)

???

- choose older photo

---

class: small-image


![Suspect selection](images/suspect_mugshot_selection_4-select-photo.png)

???

- less "accurate" photo is better: dark!

# Filler Selection

- identical twins: too close
- clearly different race or gender: too far
- where's goldilocks?

---


class: small-image

## Select filler photos

![filler selection](images/filler-selection.png)

???

- based on **witness description**, not suspect picture


---
class: small-image

## Review suspect photo


![Suspect selection](images/filler-selection_suspect_detail.png)

???

- it's a modal; can't see the filler pics

---

class: inverse

### Dark Design Pattern #2:

# Don't show photo

- select filler photos based on description, not (subjective) photo comparison
- science says its better
- similar opportunities to follow science when various descriptions (witness(es), suspect, etc.) conflict.

---

# The old way

???

- cop interviews witness, can shape recollection (memory can be faulty)
- cop testifies, judge hears the cop's version (confidence can be overstated)

---

# The better way

???

- blind administrator
- cop gives witness ipad, impartial repeatable instructions
- judge sees the witness give testimony
